As sample sizes grow, the mean across sites converges closer to the actual mean of 20, demonstrating how replication (larger sample sizes) enhances precision and reduces the impact of random variation in data.\n\n#### \"Are three replications enough?\"\n\nI often hear this question and the answer is: ... well it depends...\n\nLet's consider the example above and assume a mean of 20 with a standard deviation of 5 in the control group. Now, if we assume a mean of 25 in the treatment group, this results in a treatment effect of 5 (the difference between the groups). We can then create datasets with 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 samples for each group and use this simulated data to test, using a t-test, whether the difference in group means is statistically significant.\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.heigh='5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nsample_sizes=c(2,3,5,10,20) # Different sample sizes to test\ntreatment_effects <- c(5)  # Effect size to test\nstd_devs <- c(5)         # Standard deviations to test\n\n# Generate one example dataset per combination for visualization\nexample_data <- do.call(rbind, lapply(sample_sizes, function(n) {\n  do.call(rbind, lapply(std_devs, function(sd) {\n    do.call(rbind, lapply(treatment_effects, function(effect) {\n      \n      # Generate data for control and treatment groups\n      control <- rnorm(n, mean = 20, sd = sd)\n      treatment <- rnorm(n, mean = 20 + effect, sd = sd)\n      \n      # Combine control and treatment data into a single data frame\n      data.frame(\n        group = rep(c(\"Control\", \"Treatment\"), each = n),\n        value = c(control, treatment),\n        sample_size = n,\n        sd = sd,\n        effect = effect\n      )\n    }))\n  }))\n}))\n\n# Plot the example data for each combination\nggplot(example_data, aes(x = group, y = value, fill = group)) +\n geom_point(shape=3, size=1)+\n  stat_summary(color = \"#00BA38\", fun = mean, geom = \"point\",  size = 2, position = position_nudge(x =0.2)) +\n stat_compare_means(method = \"t.test\", label.y.npc  =0.9) +\n  facet_grid(sd ~ sample_size, labeller = labeller(\n    sd = function(x) paste(\"SD =\", x),\n    sample_size = function(x) paste(\"Sample size =\", x)\n  )) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_ExpDesign_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-important\n#### Excersise\n\nCopy the code and repeat 10 times.

In our example, we would need 17 replications.\n\n# Experimental designs used in agricultural experiments\n\nThe library `agricolae` offers a variety of functions to plan your experiment.\n\n### Completely randomized design (CRD)\n\nA Completely Randomized Design (CRD) is an experimental design where all plots are randomly assigned to different treatment groups, ensuring that each group is equally likely to receive any given treatment.\n\nSuppose we want to test 5 varieties (A, B, C, D, E) with 4 replications each, distributed randomly across 20 plots. We define a vector with the treatment levels `trt=c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\")` and use the function `design.crd()` with the argument `r=4` to specify the number of replications for each variety. The `seed` argument is used to control the randomization in the experimental design. In this example, `seed=1234` is set to ensure that the random arrangement of treatments in the completely randomized design (CRD) is reproducible. Try a different number! `serie=1` controls the numbering format for the plots or experimental units.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrt=c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\")\noutdesign.crd <-design.crd(trt,r=4, serie=1, seed=1234)\nbook.crd<-outdesign.crd$book # field book\nhead(book.crd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  plots r trt\n1    11 1   D\n2    12 1   E\n3    13 1   C\n4    14 2   D\n5    15 2   C\n6    16 1   B\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe get a field book with plot numbers and treatment allocation. To plot this design, I add columns and rows and use the function `ggplot()` from `library(ggplot2)`. *Note, that I have chosen 5 rows x 4 columns. We could also use 2 rows x 10 columns or 1 row x 20 columns depending on the field proportions.*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbook.crd$col=rep(1:4, times=5)\nbook.crd$row=rep(1:5, each=4)\nhead(book.crd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  plots r trt col row\n1    11 1   D   1   1\n2    12 1   E   2   1\n3    13 1   C   3   1\n4    14 2   D   4   1\n5    15 2   C   1   2\n6    16 1   B   2   2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=book.crd, aes(x=col, y=row, fill=trt, label=trt))+\n  geom_tile(colour=1)+\n  geom_text()+\n  geom_text(aes(label=plots-10), nudge_y = 0.4, nudge_x = -0.4, size=4)+ \n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_ExpDesign_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis design is highly flexible, allowing for a varying number of treatments and replications as needed. It is also straightforward to analyse using linear models such as ANOVA and regression (e.g., `mod <- lm(y ~ trt, data = dat)`) or generalized linear models (e.g., `mod <- glm(y ~ trt, family = \"poisson\", data = dat)`).\n\nHowever, challenges may arise with this CRD design if there are underlying gradients among experimental plots that affect the response, such as soil heterogeneity, which can introduce unwanted variability into the results.\n\n### Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)\n\nIn a Randomized Complete Block Design we con control for the variability among experimental plots (e.g. gradients in soil conditions) by building blocks. A block represents a relatively homogeneous set of conditions. Each block receives each treatment exactly once, which means all treatments are \"completely randomized\" within each block. The number of blocks represents the number of replications.\n\nTo create a field plan in an RCBD we use the function `design.rcbd` from the library `agricolae`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrt=c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\",\"E\")\noutdesign.rcbd <-design.rcbd(trt, r=4,serie=1, seed=1236, \"Wichmann-Hill\")\nbook.rcbd<-outdesign.rcbd$book# field book\nhead(book.rcbd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  plots block trt\n1    11     1   E\n2    12     1   D\n3    13     1   B\n4    14     1   A\n5    15     1   C\n6    21     2   C\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nColumns represent now the number of levels in the treatment (but not the treatment levels).

This way, the treatment effect can be separated from the block effect in the analysis, making it easier to detect differences among treatments.\n\nIf you have many blocks (more than 5 some say more than 8), block may be also treated as random effect in a mixed effect model. To fit these models you can use:\n\n+ `library(glmmTMB)` for linear mixed effect model `mod<-glmmTMB(y ~ trt +  (1|block), data=dat)` or generalised linear mixed effect model `mod<-glmmTMB(y ~ trt + (1|block), data=dat, family=\"poisson\")` or \n+ `library(lme4)` with `mod<-lmer(y ~ trt + (1|block), data=dat)` and `mod<-glmer(y ~ trt + (1|block), data=d, family=\"poisson\")`.\n\nThese models assume a single measurement per treatment replication. However, if multiple measurements are taken within each replication (e.g., counting the number of aphids on 10 plants per plot), you have two options:\n\n-   Aggregate the data: You can calculate summary statistics, like the mean or sum, per plot to represent a single value for each replication.\n-   Account for pseudoreplications: Alternatively, if you wish to retain the individual measurements, you can account for pseudoreplications by including a random effect for each plot, representing the level at which measurements occur without randomization. The mixed effect model would be: `mod<-glmmTMB(y ~ trt + block + (1|PlotID), data=dat)` or `mod<-lmer(y ~ trt + block + (1|PlotID), data=dat)` with PlotID having 20 levels. \n\nThis random effect accounts for the variability within plots and prevents pseudoreplications from inflating the sample size and violating the independence assumption.\n\n### Latin Square Design (LSD)\n\nIn a Latin Square design you can control for two independent gradients in x and y direction. Each treatment appears exactly once in each row and each column. This design ensures that any variation due to row and column factors is minimized, allowing a clearer analysis of the treatment effects. The number of treatments in a LSD is equal to the number of rows and columns limiting the design to a relatively small number of treatments.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noutdesign.lsd <-design.lsd(trt, serie=1, seed=1238, kinds = \"Super-Duper\",first=T,\n                           randomization=T)\nbook.lsd<-outdesign.lsd$book# field book\nhead(book.lsd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  plots row col trt\n1    11   1   1   E\n2    12   1   2   A\n3    13   1   3   D\n4    14   1   4   C\n5    15   1   5   B\n6    21   2   1   A\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbook.lsd$row=as.integer(book.lsd$row)\nggplot(data=book.lsd, aes(x=col, y=row, fill=trt, label=trt))+\n  geom_tile(colour=1)+\n  geom_text()+\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:5)+\n  geom_text(aes(label=plots-10), nudge_y = 0.4, nudge_x = -0.4, size=4)+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")+\n  coord_fixed()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_ExpDesign_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe data can be analyzed using treatment and rows and columns as factors \n\n+ in a linear model (e.g., `mod <- lm(y ~ trt + row + col, data = dat)`) or \n+ in a generalized linear model (e.g., `mod <- glm(y ~ trt + row + col, family = \"poisson\", data = dat)`).\n\n### LSD with two different treatments\n\nHere is the code for a LSD with two different treatments, e.g. three genotypes (g1, g2, and g3) with two management types (m1, m2).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf=expand.grid(geno=c(\"g1\", \"g2\", \"g3\"), man=c(\"m1\", \"m2\")) # generates all combinations\ntrt2=paste(df$geno, df$man, sep=\".\")\noutdesign.lsd <-design.lsd(trt2, serie=1, seed=1238, kinds = \"Super-Duper\",first=T,\n                           randomization=T)\nbook.lsd<-outdesign.lsd$book# field book\nhead(book.lsd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  plots row col  trt2\n1    11   1   1 g2.m2\n2    12   1   2 g3.m2\n3    13   1   3 g1.m1\n4    14   1   4 g3.m1\n5    15   1   5 g2.m1\n6    16   1   6 g1.m2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbook.lsd$row=as.integer(book.lsd$row)\nggplot(data=book.lsd, aes(x=col, y=row, fill=trt2, label=trt2))+\n  geom_tile(colour=1)+\n  geom_text()+\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=1:6)+\n  geom_text(aes(label=plots-10), nudge_y = 0.4, nudge_x = -0.4, size=4)+ \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](07_ExpDesign_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe data can be analyzed with geno * man main effect and interaction and rows and columns as factors \n\n+ using linear models  (e.g., `mod <- lm(y ~ geno*man + row + col, data = dat)`) or \n+ generalized linear models (e.g., `mod <- glm(y ~ geno*man + row + col, family = \"poisson\", data = dat)`).\n\n### Split-Plot Design\n\nIn a split-plot design we have two treatments, of which one treatment is nested within the other. \n\nExample: If the machinery for sowing is not applicable for individual plots, but fertilisation can be applied to plot level, then we allocate the genotype as main-plot in a randomized complete block design, and allocate randomly the fertilisation levels as sub-plots within the main plots.
